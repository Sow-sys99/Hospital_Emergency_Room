KPI's Requirements

To enhance operational efficiency and provide actionsble insights into emergency room perfarmanre, we need to create a Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard in Power BI. This salution will enable stakeholders to track, analyze, and make data-driven decisions regarding patient management and service optimization

Number of Patients: Measure the total number of patients visiting the ER daily.

Average Wait Time: Calculate the average time patients wait before being attended to by a medical professional..

Patient Satisfaction Score : Analyze the average satisfaction score of patients on a daily basis to evaluate the quality of service provided.

Number of Patients Referred: Count the number of patients referred to specific departments from the ER each day.

Dashboard 1: Monthly View

Objective: Monitor key metrics and trends on a month-by-month basis to identify patterns and areas for improvement.

Charts  Developed:

Patient Admission Status: Track admitted vs. non-admitted patients.

Patient Age Distribution: Group patients by 10-year age intervals.

Department Referrals: Analyze referral trends across different departments.

Timeliness: Measure the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes.

Gender Analysis: Visualize patient distribution by gender.

Racial Demographics: Analyze patient data by race.

Time Analysis: Assess patient volume by day and hour.

Dashboard 2: Consolidated View

Objective: Provide a holistic summary of hospital performance for a selected date range.

Charts  Developed:

Similar metrics as the Monthly View, but aggregated over a customizable date range for broader insights and trend analysis.

Dashboard 3: Patient Details

Objective: Offer granular Insights into patient-level data to enable detailed analysis and troubleshooting.

Charts  Developed: A grid displaying essential fields:

Patient ID
Patient Full Name
Gender
Age
Admission Date
Patient Race
Wait Time
Department Referral
Admission Status

Dashboard 4: Consolidated View

Objective: Summarize the findings from all dashboards to provide clear and actionable insights for stakeholders.

Charts  Developed:

Descriptive analysis of each metric and visualization, including pattems, anomalies, and actionable recommendations to optimil emergency room operations and patient care..
